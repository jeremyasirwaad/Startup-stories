    "information": "The Swayamvaram..\n\n15 calls! Yes, 15 in 5 days. \n\nSome founders were desperate! \n\nOne even asked for feedback on the interview process. \n\nFor Pavithra Lakshmikanthabharathi (Civil 2023), this was a week that may change her life. She was overwhelmed and exhausted talking to so many founders.\n\nShe even had to reject an offer from a firm that is into Metaverse (Of course, the Founder asked her to stay in touch.)\n\nAnd finally it had to be Orangewood Labs (They are into building Robots), a Y Combinator firm from the 2018 cohort. \n \nPavi shall work remotely from GCT as a paid intern. \n\nShe shall spend some time as an Executive Assistant to the Co-Founder before taking up a Product Management Role, a role many IIM Grads covet.\n\nPavi. Congrats!! This is big. Very big. A Y Combinator Firm on your resume shall put your career on a completely different orbit. \n\nGood luck. And God Bless.",
